# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is this solution?
This is an enterprise-ready solution that sits between your applications and Azure OpenAI, providing usage tracking, cost management, and chargeback capabilities through Azure API Management.

### What problem does it solve?
- **APIM Log Truncation**: Azure APIM diagnostic logs have an 8192-byte limit, causing large OpenAI payloads to be truncated
- **Cost Tracking**: No native way to track and allocate OpenAI usage costs across departments/users
- **Data Governance**: Need for minimal data persistence and flexible retention policies
- **Scalability**: Handle varying data volumes and formats efficiently

### Who should use this solution?
- **Primary**: Enterprise Azure architects and DevOps engineers
- **Secondary**: Security teams, Cost management teams, AI/ML platform teams
- **Tertiary**: Compliance officers and data governance teams

## Technical Questions

### What is the maximum payload size supported?
**Answer**: Up to 100MB, significantly larger than the standard 8KB APIM diagnostic log limit.

The solution bypasses APIM logging limitations by:
- Processing payloads in Azure Functions (Python)
- Using Redis for temporary storage
- Implementing custom logging mechanisms

### How long is usage data retained?
**Answer**: 30 days by default, but it's fully configurable.

You can adjust retention periods in:
- Redis cache TTL settings
- Azure Cosmos DB retention policies
- Blob storage lifecycle management

### Can this solution be deployed in multiple regions?
**Answer**: Yes, the solution supports multi-region deployment.

Features include:
- Active-active configuration
- Regional failover capabilities
- Data replication strategies
- Load balancing across regions

### How does the solution handle Azure OpenAI throttling?
**Answer**: The solution implements intelligent retry logic and request queuing.

Technical implementation:
- Uses Python's `tenacity` library for exponential backoff
- Implements circuit breaker patterns
- Queue management for high-throughput scenarios
- Graceful degradation under load

### What happens if Redis cache is unavailable?
**Answer**: The solution falls back to direct processing without caching.

Fallback mechanisms:
- Circuit breaker detects Redis failures
- Direct Azure OpenAI processing continues
- Usage tracking switches to immediate storage
- Automatic recovery when Redis comes back online

### What programming languages are supported?
**Answer**: The Function App is written in Python, but clients can use any language.

- **Function App**: Python 3.9+
- **Client SDKs**: Python, C#/.NET, Node.js, PowerShell, curl, and more
- **IaC Options**: Bicep (primary), Terraform, ARM templates, Pulumi

## Deployment Questions

### Why is Bicep the recommended IaC tool?
**Answer**: Bicep provides better Azure integration and simplified syntax.

Benefits:
- Native Azure integration
- Type safety and IntelliSense
- Simplified syntax vs ARM templates
- Better error messages
- Seamless ARM template compilation

However, we support multiple IaC tools to accommodate different preferences.

### Can I use .NET instead of Python for the Function App?
**Answer**: While designed for Python, Azure Functions support multiple runtimes.

Options:
- **Current**: Python 3.9+ (recommended)
- **Alternative**: You can adapt to .NET/C#, Node.js, or Java
- **Consideration**: Would require rewriting the function logic
- **Support**: Community contributions welcome for other runtimes

### How do I migrate from ARM templates to Bicep?
**Answer**: We provide migration scripts and documentation.

Resources:
- Migration scripts in `/docs/migration/`
- Azure CLI decompile command: `az bicep decompile`
- Step-by-step migration guide

## Security Questions

### How is sensitive data protected?
**Answer**: Multiple layers of security and minimal data persistence.

Security measures:
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Azure AD integration with RBAC
- **Network Security**: Private endpoints and NSG rules
- **Secrets**: Azure Key Vault for sensitive data
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Retention**: Configurable data retention policies

### What data is stored and for how long?
**Answer**: Only usage metadata is stored, not actual conversation content.

Data stored:
- ‚úÖ Token counts and costs
- ‚úÖ User IDs and timestamps
- ‚úÖ Model information
- ‚ùå Actual conversation content
- ‚ùå Personal information

Retention:
- Redis: Short-term (hours to days)
- Cosmos DB: Medium-term (30 days default)
- Blob Storage: Long-term reports (configurable)

### Is the solution compliant with enterprise security standards?
**Answer**: Yes, designed with enterprise security in mind.

Compliance features:
